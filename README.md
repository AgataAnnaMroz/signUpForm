# signUpForm
**My very first project added to the repository. Created solely to practice HTML forms (styling, validation, animations, etc.) and to try out git and GitHub.**

In the nearest future planning to develop both the code and the README description. 

Visit my **Sign Up Form** on **GitHub Pages**: [signUpForm](https://agataannamroz.github.io/signUpForm/).
